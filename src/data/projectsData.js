    description: 'Connect Four, a game created by Howard Wexler, was first sold under the Connect Four trademark by Milton Bradley in 1974. In this game, each player selects a color and takes turns dropping colored tokens into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid. The objective is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of their tokens. The game has become a quintessential American classic and is enjoyed by people of all ages.',
